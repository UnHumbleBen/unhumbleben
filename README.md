### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from UC Davis with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering. I love studying computation and writing code. I am fascinated
by two questions:

1. How can we use computers to solve problems in the natural world?
2. How can we use the things found in the natural world to create computers?
    * We can build computers from circuits :zap:, DNA :dna:, and even [dominos](https://youtu.be/OpLU__bhu2w)!

Previously, I was a Software Enginnering Intern at Cisco where I worked with some of the smartest people in the industry. Currently I work as a 
undergraduate researcher for the [UC-Davis Molecular Computing Group](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing) developing [scadnano](https://scadnano.org/),
a web application for designing DNA nanostructures.

Some other things I enjoy include sports :soccer: :football: :basketball:, space exploration :rocket:, physics :apple:, and mathematics.

#### Why "Un"HumbleBen?

> Good work is not done by 'humble' men. It is one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject,
to exaggerate a little both the importance of his subject and his importance in it. - G. H. Hardy
