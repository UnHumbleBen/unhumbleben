### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently a undergraduate student at UC Davis majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I love studying computation and writing code. I am fascinated
by not only the abundance of computer applications in the natural world, but also by the plethora of natural world applications for developing
computers.

Previously, I was a Software Enginnering Intern at Cisco where I worked with some of the smartest people in the industry. Currently I work as a 
undergraduate researcher for the [UC-Davis Molecular Computing Group](https://github.com/UC-Davis-molecular-computing) developing [scadnano](https://scadnano.org/),
a web application for designing DNA nanostructures.

Some other things I enjoy include sports :soccer: :football: :basketball:, space exploration :rocket:, and mathematics.

PS: My favorite animals are penguins! :penguin: :penguin: :penguin: Why? Cause they're cute!

#### Why "Un"HumbleBen

My friends call me humble, but a *truly* humble person would know that they are not humble.
